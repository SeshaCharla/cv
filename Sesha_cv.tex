\section{Work Experience}
\noindent \textsc{Virgin Hyperloop} \hfill Los Angeles, California, USA.\\
\vspace{3pt}
\textbf{\textit{Motion Control Engineering Intern}} \hfill Jun. 2022 $-$ Aug. 2022
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=0.25in,label={--}]
    \item Developed a supervisory control for minimizing the force mismatch
across the bogie for improving EM engine efficiency and worked out the necessary
requirements through cross team meetings.
\item Refined the control architecture for single EM engine control and
demonstrated the limitation of the linear design on the non-linear system.
\item Developed a MIMO model for the guidance bogie engine assembly and worked
out the stability of off-diagonal elements w.r.t suspension parameters.
