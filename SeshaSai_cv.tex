\section{Work Experience}
\noindent \textsc{U.R Rao Satellite centre (URSC) - Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)} \hfill Benguluru, India \\

\vspace{3pt}
\textbf{\textit{Thermal Test Engineer [Scientist/Engineer "SC"], Thermal Systems Group}} \hfill Jul. 2016 $-$ Jul. 2019
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,nolistsep,leftmargin=0.25in,label={--}]
    \item Worked thermal instrumentation and control for thermal-vacuum and thermal-balance tests of satellite systems.
	\item Team lead for \textit{Chandrayan-2} (the lunar lander project of ISRO) mission's orbiter, lander and rover.
    \item Augmented the software of existing \textit{SCADA} system for simultaneous testing of multiple satellites, doubling the productivity of test systems.
	\item Improved and standardized the heater design through a web application to streamline PI gain tuning and in-situ heater sensor mapping for the technology development program: \textit{Automation of thermal control during satellite tests}.
    \item Held the position of \textit{Project Manager: Thermal Testing, Human Space Program (HSP)} from Jan. $2019$ to Jul. $2019$, to assist in development of procedures and infrastructure for thermal vacuum and thermal balance testing of the proposed new designs of the spacecrafts.\\
